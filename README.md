This project consolidates sales data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) into a unified data warehouse optimized for analytics and reporting.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![Data Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 📊 Analytics Framework
Comprehensive analytical approach covering:

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Database Exploration**: Schema and structure analysis
- **Dimensions Analysis**: Customer geography, product hierarchy
- **Date Analysis**: Temporal coverage and customer demographics
- **Measures Analysis**: Key business metrics and KPIs
- **Magnitude Analysis**: Distribution across dimensions
- **Ranking Analysis**: Top and bottom performers

### Advanced Analytics
- **Change Over Time**: Monthly trends and seasonality
- **Cumulative Analysis**: Running totals and progressive growth
- **Performance Analysis**: Product performance vs. benchmarks
- **Part-to-Whole**: Category contribution analysis
